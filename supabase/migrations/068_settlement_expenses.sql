-- Migration 068: fold workspace expenses into the server settlement rails (GVM-173)
--
-- Part 2 of GVM-173. Migration 067 made expenses period-scoped; now the
-- integrity rails must know about them, or closing a period would archive a
-- fuel-only settlement that disagrees with what the app showed (client folds
-- expenses in via settlement-calc.ts).
--
-- Two functions change, both used by close_settlement_period:
--   * calculate_period_settlement — each expense credits its payer the full
--     amount and debits every active member their split share; net becomes
--     fuelPaid + expensePaid − tripCost − expenseShare.
--   * calculate_period_entry_fingerprint — gains the sorted expense id set so a
--     changed expense invalidates a stale close, exactly like trips/fuel.
--
-- Split parity: shares use per-member proportional rounding —
-- round(amount * weight / total_weight, 2) — the SAME arithmetic as the client
-- (settlement-calc.ts splitByWeights, simplified to match) and consistent with
-- how fuel tripCost already rounds per member. Rule resolution: an expense's
-- split_rule, else the ledger's per-category default, else 'equal'. Weights:
-- equal → 1 each; usage → each member's (unrounded) km; custom → split_config
-- weight. When a rule's weights sum to zero (e.g. usage with no km, or a custom
-- map with no active member) it falls back to equal, matching the client.
