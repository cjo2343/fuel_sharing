# Fuel Sharing

A lightweight car-sharing fuel ledger for friends.

## Features

- Log trips with start and end odometer values.
- Split trip distance between only the people who joined that trip.
- Log fuel payments.
- Calculate each person's fuel share from actual fuel paid divided by shared kilometers.
- Track payment requests and close settlement periods.
- Archive closed periods.
- Supabase email-code login.
- Logged-in users are locked to their assigned member profile.
- Admins can change group settings and delete/fix entries.
- Supabase Realtime reloads the ledger when another user changes it.

## Local Development

```sh
python3 server.py
```

Open `http://localhost:4175/`.

If that port is busy:

```sh
PORT=4176 python3 server.py
```

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Update `supabase-config.js` with your project URL and anon key.
4. Set `enabled: true`.
5. In Authentication -> URL Configuration, add your deployed URL and localhost redirect URL.
6. In Authentication -> Email Templates, use an OTP-code template with `{{ .Token }}`.

Recommended email template:

```html
<h2>Your Fuel Ledger login code</h2>

<p>Open Fuel Ledger here:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com?login=1">
    Open Fuel Ledger
  </a>
</p>

<p>Then enter this code in the app:</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 32px; letter-spacing: 4px;">{{ .Token }}</h1>

<p>This code expires soon.</p>
<p>If you did not request this, you can ignore this email.</p>
```

## Member and Admin Setup

The group settings textarea supports this format, one member per line:

```text
Christian | christian@example.com | admin
Marie | marie@example.com
Jonas | jonas@example.com
```

- The first signed-in user can bootstrap the setup if no member emails are configured yet.
- After emails are configured, each logged-in user is locked to their matching member name.
- Add `| admin` to users who should be allowed to edit settings, reset data, close periods, and delete entries.

## Deployment on Render

Use a Web Service.

```text
Build command: echo "No build needed"
Start command: python3 server.py
```

No Resend API key is needed in Render when Resend is connected through Supabase SMTP.
